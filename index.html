                            <p class="br">Helping people to develop their full potential, in life and career, is my
                                obsession. We
                                all deserve to
                                feel fulfilled and passionate about what we do, and happy with our life, don't you
                                think?</p>

                            <p>As your coach, I’m here to provide guidance and support you to design the life and career
                                of your
                                dreams.
                                But let me get this straight, I am not here to tell you what to do.</p>
                            <p class="br">My commitment is to ask you thought-provoking, powerful [and sometimes
                                uncomfortable]
                                questions to help
                                you go from surviving to thriving by building your best life abroad.</p>

                            <p>My coaching method is based on simple ingredients: clarity, plan and action.</p>
                            <p>Be ready to dive into yourself.</p>
                            <p>Be ready to create a roadmap.</p>
                            <p>Be ready to do things.</p>
